# 100-Days-of-Code-Challenge

### Why I Started This Project

- 25/03/2020: People in my Coder Academy cohort decided to create a stand-up channel on Slack, so we can share our achievements, blockers and goals with each other and keep us motived üí™ (Special credit to Harry :star:).

- 08/04/2020: I decided to also keep a copy on my GitHub to remind myself how far I've come. üëëüòä

- 12/04/2020: Decided to incorporate the concepts of '100 Days of Code' challenge into this repo (I record entries every day and push them to GitHub weekly).
