# 100-Days-of-Code-Challenge

### Why I Started This Project

- 25/03/2020: People in my Coder Academy cohort decided to create a stand-up channel on Slack, so we can share our achievements, blockers and goals with each other and keep us motived 💪 (Special credit to Harry :star:).

- 08/04/2020: I decided to also keep a copy on my GitHub to remind myself how far I've come. 👑😊

- 12/04/2020: Decided to incorporate the concepts of '100 Days of Code' challenge into this repo (I record entries every day and push them to GitHub weekly).

- 1500 Interview (Company AGS): I didn't realise that the company wanted to have an on-site interview (I thought it was just a phone screening), so this one might be cancelled or rescheduled. I wrote an email to the manager to apologise for the misunderstanding, and asked if he would like to have an initial phone interview at 3 pm today. And we can have another on-site one if everything goes well today. Still awaiting reply.

  With WordPress, there’s no need to set up routers like React and no need to worry about responsiveness in CSS (it's responsive by default). You can build a simple website without coding a single line… No wonder it's such a powerful & popular too! Although I still prefer to build a website by actual coding 😆
