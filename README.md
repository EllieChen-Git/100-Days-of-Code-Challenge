# Daily Stand-ups

### Why I Started This Project

- 25/03/2020: People in my cohort decided to create a stand-up channel on Slack, so we can share our achievements, blockers and goals with each other and keep us motived ðŸ’ª (Credit to Harry :star:).

- 08/04/2020: I decided to also keep a copy on my GitHub to remind myself how far I've come. ðŸ‘‘ðŸ˜Š

- 12/04/2020: Decided to incorporate the concepts of '100 Days of Code' challenge into this repo.
