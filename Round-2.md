### Project Timeline

- 18/03/2020: Started the '100 Days of Code' project.

- 25/03/2020: People in my Coder Academy cohort decided to create a stand-up channel on Slack, so we can share our achievements, blockers and goals with each other and keep us motived üí™ (Special credit to Harry :star:).

- 08/04/2020: Decided to keep a copy of records on my GitHub to remind myself how far I have come in my coding journey. üëëüòä

- 01/06/2020: Decided to report my daily progress on Twitter, and have been received lots of support from the tech community since then!

- 25/06/2020: Achieved 100 days of code!!!

- **26/06/2020: After 100 days, I decided to change the format of the record by only noting down the things I achieved every day to avoid repetition.**
